      <p>You draw your gun with average speed, fumbling with it as you carefully line up your shots. While you manage to pick a few bandits off, they have more than enough time to fire in return. Before things get hairier, you decide to escape on your horse. However, as you mount up, a stray bullet enters its left eye and exits through its right eye killing it instantly. The beast collapses and you manage to escape with your life. But you have a longer journey ahead of you now, and the desert heat will do no favors for the Sheriffâ€™s body.</p>
