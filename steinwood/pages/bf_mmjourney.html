      <p>As the mining towns boom and bust across the desert, Refinery stands true. 
        The factories here process metals from all over the Southwest into usable commodities. 
        Although it’s not marked on any maps or noted in any accounting logs, 
        Goodenough Restorations receives many of these commodities—and that’s where you’re headed. 
        As you walk onto the town’s main street, all you can think about is who’s paying to keep 
        Goodenough under wraps.</p>
