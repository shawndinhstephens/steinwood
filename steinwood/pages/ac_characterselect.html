          - You’re the lightest sheriff’s deputy in Steinwood. 
          A stiff breeze could send you tumbling like a weed over the desert. 
          In your youth, you took advantage of your slight frame to pick pockets and slip into places you didn’t belong. 
          Nowadays you use your gift to sneak up on criminals, letting the Sheriff tackle his prey in a moment of surprise and take the glory. 
          After all he’s done for you, you feel that’s the least you can do.

        <p>
          You’re the handsomest sheriff’s deputy in Steinwood. 
          With a jaw chiseled from bronze and a voice like melted chocolate, 
          you effortlessly charm just about anyone you run across. As a boy, 
          your ambitions outgrew your abilities and made you lazy; 
          if you couldn’t do it right the first time, why do it at all? 
          Instead, you used your easy charm to sucker folks in town, to “lend” 
          you things or to paint fences for you.  The Sheriff promised you something more, 
          though: lock up criminals for long enough and you, too, could be a Sheriff someday. 
          The allure of that kind of power keeps you going.

          You’re the biggest, baddest, burliest deputy in the Steinwood. 
          It’s a wonder you don’t send the doors of saloon flying off its 
          hinges every time you stop in for a drink—though, the barman is 
          tired of having to constantly patch up the squeaky floorboard he
          installed at the entrance. You’ve always been the Sheriff’s right
          hand man—and that won’t ever change. Mostly because you don’t have
          half a mind to overthrow the Sheriff with your own raw physical force.
