          As the mining towns boom and bust, Refinery is still there, processing the metal into usable commodities. 
          Although it’s not marked on any maps, shipping manifests, or accounting logs, the Goodenough Restorations 
          building receives many of these usable products.
          The mechromancer. She’s a big lady, similar in stature to Suggins. Her hair is pulled tight 
          into a ponytail, covered in the front by a bandana. You can’t help but notice the soot on her arms—some patches 
          of it seem uneven, as though they’re covering up burns. 
          Her business, like most in the town of Refinery, was purchased by Bandervilt. She has no love for the man, only
          for the miracles she works within the walls of her factory. Rumor has it she can raise a man from the dead using only machines…

          Located in the abandoned silver mining town of Glintmouth. 
          When the mines ran dry (read: they dug into some eldritch tomb 
          that turned the silver worthless or something), the train tracks did too. 
          The clocktower of the once-bustling Steinwood Station stands abandoned, 
          a rotting skeleton amidst the dust clouds.
          The occultist you’re looking for has since taken up residence there. He keeps a watchful 
          eye on the hills from behind the eastmost clock face. He tries to protect the world from the horrors that lay within the mines, and in doing so has learned a great deal of dark secrets.
